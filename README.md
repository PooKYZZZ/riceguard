## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### Backend
1. Navigate to the backend folder  
   `cd backend`
2. Install dependencies  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file (see `.env.example` for reference)
4. Run the server  
   `uvicorn main:app --reload`
5. The API will be available at **http://localhost:8000**

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend folder  
   `cd frontend`
2. Install dependencies  
   `npm install`
3. Run the app  
   `npx expo start`
4. Scan the QR code to open on your mobile device

### Machine Learning
- The `ml/` folder contains training scripts and TensorFlow Lite models used for disease classification.  
- Model files are loaded by the mobile app for offline use.
